A recent SQL health claim challenge data set and questionaire 



Question 4:
Any missing field that is required for any match key from claims data can contribute to lower data integrity. While we can, with some confidence, generate line numbers based on additional data to generate a match key (such as assigning a line number per distinct procedure code and service date), there is still the risk of misrepresenting the final claims amount through mis-match and duplicates, along with potential aggregate errors.
